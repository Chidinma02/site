                        <h3>Creativity</h3>
                        <p>Creativity: the act of creating new things. It’s innovative and fresh. Mind-blowing but relaxing. Creativity is putting our thoughts into motion and turning the intangible into something we can feel.

                        </p>
                        <p>Being creative means solving a problem in a new way. It means changing your perspective.</p>
                        <p>Being creative means taking risks and ignoring doubt and facing fears. It means breaking with routine and doing something different for the sake of doing something different. It means mapping out a thousand different routes to reach one destination. It means challenging yourself every day. Being creative means searching for inspiration in even the most mundane places. It means you’re asking stupid questions. It means creating without critiquing. Being creative means you know how to find the similarities and differences between two completely random ideas.</p>
                        <p>With every step you take to create something, you change this world. You offer it something new. Just by writing words, talking to people, running around your neighborhood, you change circumstances. You leave a trail of ideas, of footprints, of life, of memories. You give life into things that were not there before.</p>

                <section class="container-fluid c">
                    <div class="main-section pt-4 pb-4 mt-5 mb-5 pl-4" id="Creativity-and-purpose">
                        <h3>Creativity and purpose</h3>
                        <p>To create is to move toward your purpose in life. To create is to move towards change.

                            It’s time to embrace this creative nature in us – and truly get to know the artist living inside of us, waiting to touch the communities around us.
                            
                            </p>
                            <p>We are all creative. We are all artists. It’s in our nature – we crave innovation + stories of change. Innovation is around us in so many ways. It’s reaching out to an old friend. Sending a thank you note or a gift. Surprising your mom with flowers. Coaching a friend in your favorite sport. Sending an email to your co-workers. What we all do is an art – it makes the world turn.

                                Don’t think that you have to own a paintbrush or a piano to be an artist.
                                
                                You are creative just as you are.
                                
                                And you know what?</p>
                                <p><blockquote>It’s not about what holds you back, it’s about what makes you energized to create goodness and love in ways we can’t imagine.</blockquote></p>
